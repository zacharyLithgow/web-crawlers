In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the flours, sugar, and salt. Add the water and yeast mixture to the flours and stir. Use a dough hook and knead on slow for 3 minutes. The dough will be shaggy and very stiff. If needed, add a touch more water, bit by bit (no more than 2 tablespoons). Continue kneading until the dough comes together.", "Add in 50 grams of softened butter, bit by bit. Do this slowly – you want the butter to be completely incorporated into the dough before adding the next bit. Continue to knead for 10-15 minutes on medium speed, or until the dough is extremely smooth and elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 40-45 minutes at room temperature. It will expand very slightly.", "Lightly butter your popover pan.", "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide into three equal parts – I used my scale for this. Cover two portions lightly with plastic wrap. Lightly dust the portion you’re working with and using a rolling pin, roll it out to 1/4 inch thickness.", "With your pasta roller at the thickest setting, feed the dough through at a very slow speed. Overlap the ends to create a continuous loop. Lightly dust the dough, inside and out with flour and continue to roll, at a low speed, decreasing the thickness as you go. Use your hands to stretch and move the dough so that it doesn’t fold back on itself. When you have a paper thin sheet of dough, cut the loop (best to cut it near the top of the machine so you don’t have to feed in the dough again) and release it from the machine.", "This is where a long counter top comes in handy. You want to lay out the dough as flat as possible. If needed, cut your sheet in half – I did. Take a third of the room temperature butter and divide it between the two sheets. Use your fingers to rub the butter gently and evenly on the dough, extending all the way to the edges. Dust with a generous amount of sprinkles.", "Roll the dough up, starting at one edge, into a tight, firm log. When one sheet is rolled up, place it on the end of the other sheet and continue to roll until you have one log. Cut the log with a sharp, lightly floured knife, lengthwise, exposing the layers. Keeping the layers exposed, shape into a loose knot and place into the buttered popover pan. Cover with plastic wrap until you complete the other cruffins.", "When all the cruffins are shaped, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let proof at room temperautre until fully doubled in size, about 2-3 hours.", "If you’re making the mascarpone filling, beat the sugar into the mascarpone. Whip the whipping cream and fold into the mascarpone in batches, being careful not to deflate. Set aside in the fridge.", "Preheat your oven to 400°F and bake for 25 minutes, until puffy and golden. Let cool slightly and then remove and cool on a wire rack.", "To fill, make sure the cruffins are completely cool. Use a sharp knife and poke a hole into the top. Fold in sprinkles into the mascarpone and place in a piping bag. Pipe into the cruffin, until you feel resistance and the filling comes out the top. Enjoy!"],
